      <h1>JAZZ</h1>
      <img src="images/jazz_story.jpg" style="margin-left: 20px;">
      <p>Jazz is a kind of music in which improvisation is typically an important part. In most jazz performances,
        players
        play solos which they make up on the spot, which requires considerable skill. There is tremendous variety in
        jazz,
        but most jazz is very rhythmic, has a forward momentum called "swing," and uses "bent" or "blue" notes. You can
        often hear "call--and--response" patterns in jazz, in which one instrument, voice, or part of the band answers
        another. (You can hear Ella Fitzgerald and Roy Eldridge do "call and response" in Ella's Singing Class.) Jazz
        can
        express many different emotions, from pain to sheer joy. In jazz, you may hear the sounds of freedom-for the
        music
        has been a powerful voice for people suffering unfair treatment because of the color of the skin, or because
        they
        lived in a country run by a cruel dictator.</p>
      <p>Jazz developed in the United States in the very early part of the 20th century. New Orleans, near the mouth of
        the Mississippi River, played a key role in this development. The city's population was more diverse than
        anywhere
        else in the South, and people of African, French, Caribbean, Italian, German, Mexican, and American Indian, as
        well as English, descent interacted with one another. African-American musical traditions mixed with others and
        gradually jazz emerged from a blend of ragtime, marches, blues, and other kinds of music. At first jazz was
        mostly
        for dancing. (In later years, people would sit and listen to it.) After the first recordings of jazz were made
        in
        1917, the music spread widely and developed rapidly. The evolution of jazz was led by a series of brilliant
        musicians such as Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington (listen to Ellington in Duke's Music Class), Charlie Parker,
        and
        Miles Davis. Jazz developed a series of different styles including traditional jazz, swing (listen, for example,
        to Benny Carter, who got his start in swing music, in Benny's Music Class) bebop, cool jazz, and jazz?rock,
        among
        others. At the same time, jazz spread from the United States to many parts of the world, and today jazz
        musicians--and jazz festivals--can be found in dozens of nations. Jazz is one of the United States's greatest
        exports to the world.</p>
      <p>Free jazz players who had made a mark in the 1960s, such as Ornette Coleman , Sun Ra and the Art Ensemble of
        Chicago, continued to explore jazz from a perspective that included influences from world music. On the other
        hand, crossover/fusion artists such as guitarist George Benson and, for a time, pianist Herbie Hancock, went at
        the music from more of a pop perspective. This style eventually led to the music now referred to as “smooth”
        jazz,
        a simple, easy-listening form of jazz.
        The 1970s ushered in a period of academic interest in jazz music history and performance. Two important
        educational centers, the Berklee College of Music and North Texas State University, offered undergraduate and
        graduate degree programs. Since that time many other universities have added jazz studies to their curriculum.
        In
        addition, there was a renewed interest in big-band jazz (often referred to as “lab” or “stage” bands), beginning
        at the high school level, and big bands led by Stan Kenton, Woody Herman, Maynard Ferguson and others performed
        and led workshops for college and high schools students.

      <h1>POP</h1>
      <p>Music in the 1980s was all about image and with the advent and popularity of MTV, the images that accompanied
        artists became more important than ever. When it came to music during the decade, nothing was understated, not
        the
        sound, not the fashion, not even the charity. The 1980s reflected the beginning of a period of great income
        disparity and a focus on affluence was reflected in the music. There were also several new genres that popped up
        including, Hip Hop, New Wave and Hair Metal, all of which have influenced music today.</p>
      <p> In US, The 1980s saw the reinvention of Michael Jackson, and the worldwide superstardom of Prince, Madonna and
        Whitney
        Houston, who were all among the most successful musicians during this time.
        Michael Jackson is one of the best-selling pop and R&B music artists in history.
        Michael Jackson, along with Prince, was the first African American artist to have his music videos in heavy
        rotation on MTV, with "Beat It", and "Billie Jean". (Donna Summer placed the first two videos by an African
        American female artist, with "She Works Hard for the Money" and "Unconditional Love", both in 1983.) Jackson's
        Thriller (1982) is the best-selling album of all time, selling 25 million copies during the decade. The album
        had
        sold over 65 million copies. His other album, 1987's Bad, has the honour of being the first album in history to
        have five number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. Its accompanying world tour also made history by being
        the
        highest-grossing tour by a solo artist in the 1980s, as well as the highest-grossing at the time. In addition to
        being the biggest selling artist of the decade, Jackson had nine number-one singles – more than any other
        activities during the decade – and spent the longest time at number one (27 weeks) in the 1980s. He won numerous
        awards, including "Artist of the Decade" and "Artist of the Century", and was arguably the biggest star of the
        1980s.Madonna was the best-selling female artist of the decade. Her third studio release, True Blue, became
        the best-selling female album of the 1980s. Other Madonna albums from the decade include Like a Virgin, one of
        the
        best selling albums of all-time, and Like a Prayer ("As close to art as pop music gets," said Rolling Stone).
        Madonna made music videos a marketing tool and was among the first to make them an art form. Her songs topped
        several charts, such as: "Like a Virgin", "Papa Don't Preach", "La Isla Bonita" and "Like a Prayer". Madonna was
        named artist of the decade by several magazines and awards. </p>
      <p>Whitney Houston is one of the most successful and influential vocalists of all time.
        Whitney Houston was one of the most successful artists of the decade. Her eponymous debut studio album was the
        best-selling debut album by a solo artist at the time, and her sophomore album Whitney is the first female album
        to debut at No. 1 in the Billboard 200. She also became the first and only artist to earn seven consecutive
        number-one songs on the Billboard Hot 100, from "Saving All My Love for You" in 1985 to "Where Do Broken Hearts
        Go" in 1988. Her crossover appeal on the popular music charts as well as her prominence on MTV influenced
        generations of African American artists.</p>

      <h1>ROCK</h1>
      <img src="images/rock_story.jpg" style="margin-left: 20px;">
      <p>Beginning in 1983 and peaking in success in 1986-1990, the decade saw the resurgence of hard rock music and the
        emergence of its glam metal subgenre. Bands such as AC/DC, Queen, Def Leppard, Kiss, Mötley Crüe, Bon Jovi,
        Quiet
        Riot, Scorpions, Europe, Ratt, Twisted Sister, Poison, Dokken, Whitesnake, and Cinderella were among the most
        popular acts of the decade. The 1980s saw the emergence of wildly popular hard rock band Guns N' Roses and the
        successful comebacks of Aerosmith and Alice Cooper in the late 1980s. The success of hard rock act Van Halen
        spanned throughout the entire decade, first with singer David Lee Roth and later with Sammy Hagar. Queen, which
        had expanded its music to experimental and crossover genres in the early 1980s, returned to guitar-driven hard
        rock with The Miracle in 1989. Additionally, a few women managed to achieve stardom in the 1980s hard rock
        scene:
        Pat Benatar and Ann and Nancy Wilson of Heart, who had been around since the mid 1970s, are prime examples of
        female success in hard rock, and so are both ex-Runaways Joan Jett and Lita Ford.</p>
      <p>Some of the most successful post-punk bands at the beginning of the decade, such as Siouxsie and the Banshees
        and
        the Psychedelic Furs, also continued their success during the 1980s. Members of Bauhaus and Joy Division
        explored
        new stylistic territory as Love and Rockets and New Order respectively.
        The second generation of British post-punk bands that broke through in the early 1980s, including the Smiths,
        the
        Jesus and Mary Chain, the Cure, the Fall, the Pop Group, the Mekons, Echo and the Bunnymen and Teardrop
        Explodes,
        tended to move away from dark sonic landscapes.</p>
      <p>The arrival of MTV in 1981 would usher in new wave's most successful era. British artists, unlike many of their
        American counterparts, had learned how to use the music video early on. Several British acts signed to
        independent labels were able to outmarket and outsell American artists that were signed with major labels.
        Journalists labelled this phenomenon a "Second British Invasion".

        In autumn 1982, "I Ran (So Far Away)" by A Flock of Seagulls entered the Billboard Top Ten, arguably the first
        successful song that owed almost everything to video. They would be followed by bands like Duran Duran whose
        glossy videos would come to symbolize the power of MTV. Dire Straits' "Money for Nothing" gently poked fun at
        MTV which had helped make them international rock stars. In 1983, 30% of the record sales were from British
        acts. 18 of the top 40 and 6 of the top 10 singles on July 18 were by British artists. Overall record sales
        would
        rise by 10% from 1982. Newsweek magazine featured Annie Lennox and Boy George on the cover of one of its
        issues while Rolling Stone Magazine would release an England Swings issue. In April 1984 40 of the top 100
        singles were from British acts while 8 of the top 10 singles in a May 1985 survey were of British origin.
        Veteran music journalist Simon Reynolds theorized that similar to the first British Invasion the use of black
        American influences by the British acts helped to spur success. Commentators in the mainstream media credited
        MTV and the British acts with bringing colour and energy to back to pop music while rock journalists were
        generally hostile to the phenomenon because they felt it represented image over content. MTV continued its
        heavy rotation of videos by new wave-oriented acts until 1987 when it changed to a heavy metal and rock
        dominated
        format.
